# OpenFirmwareManager
A generic macOS kernel extension that handles firmware operations.

Currently it only supports decompressing binaries. I will try to add support for files in the future and also add scripts that could compress the binaries in the first place.

Further testing is needed to verify that it would work, and I don't think it could clearly identify the state of firmwares right now.
